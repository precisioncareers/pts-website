    <h2 class="col-12">PTS Backstory</h2>
    <p class="col-12 blocktext">PTS was cofounded in 2015 by Jake Frazer, a former U.S. Army officer and
      24-year Veteran of government contracting. After serving in Germany and Bosnia as a Cavalry officer, Jake went into government
      contracting in the late 90s. In the Balkans, he worked for Brown &amp; Root, the
      precursor to KBR. During his six years working in Europe, the U.S., and the Middle
      East inside one of the industry leaders, he observed the necessity of finding the right
      people for the mission.</p>
    <p class="col-12 blocktext">For almost ten years, Jake was the co-owner and C-Suite executive for a medium-
      sized international supply chain company, a leading prime to the U.S. Government,
      and an outsourced partner for major primes in the contingency contracting arena.
      While supply chain was the mission, talent remained the apparent challenge. During
      this decade of working across the industry, Jake built a strong understanding of
      many government programs and significantly extended his professional network.</p>
    <p class="col-12 blocktext">Jake set up PTS in 2015 specifically to focus on the challenge of talent in the
      government contracting sector. Initially, the strategy for PTS was to be a SaaS-based
      matchmaking technology platform. PTS reoriented that technology to support actual
      recruitment. Jake has built PTS into one of the &quot;Top GovCon Recruiters&quot; in the
      industry, according to Jim Garretson of Executive Mosaic.</p>
