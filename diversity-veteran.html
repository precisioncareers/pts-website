         From the beginning of our talks, it was clear PTS held a sincere and
         honest interest in me. The PTS team took the time to ensure I was informed and
         prepared for every step. I appreciate their professionalism, smooth
         communication, and thoughtfulness throughout the entire application and
         interview process.

         Government contracting is making considerable strides in Diversity and
         Veteran hiring. Each vacant senior role for our customers is an
         opportunity to add diversity, but this requires active and
         well-resourced recruiting to be successful.
