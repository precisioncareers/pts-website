   text: The PTS team coordinated and were present for every meeting with the key stakeholders and stayed in close contact through my first day and followed up 4-6 weeks after I started the new role to confirm with me that I had made the correct career decision. It was an excellent experience working with PTS.

   title: Sr. Director, Business Development, GardaWorld
   text: I was approached by a recruiter from the PTS firm for a position that I didn't believe I was qualified to fill. Martyn Brooks, who works for Jake and is based in England, met with me nonetheless to see if we could find another position to discuss. The best interviewing process I have ever been part of and I am very excited about my new position at Gardaworld Federal Services.

   text: I have heard Jake talk about his simple formula for success - treat folks the right way (both clients and candidates), work hard, and do a good job. I wondered if it was just Jake that was like this. Oh no, the entire team is this way. What a pleasure it is/was to work with these folks. I truly owe the opportunities I am enjoying today to the caring assistance I received from PTS.
