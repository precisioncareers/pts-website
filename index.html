   text: Finding great IT talent is hard…finding cleared IT talent for a project in Germany is even tougher. We worked on filling a key leadership role with both internal recruiting resources and external agencies, but we were never able to find the right fit. We engaged the team at PTS in hopes of helping us solve this challenge. Their team jumped on the project with a thorough kickoff call, provided a very informative calibration list, and they were presenting candidates for interviews within just a couple of weeks. The first panel of 5 candidates was spot on, and we were able to move to final interviews quickly to pick a great talent. I would definitely recommend PTS to other companies that operate in the GovCon space, especially for highly technical IT roles on classified programs.

   text: The ISOA Board of Directors and I brought in PTS to help identify candidates for a critical role within our organization. The PTS team engaged all the relevant stakeholders, collected necessary information beyond the position description, and worked directly with the Board to manage a complex search process. PTS penetrated the relevant professional associations in the sector and brought forward for consideration multiple qualified candidates. Their technology made assessing candidates easy, and they were hands-on even facilitating multiple rounds of in-person interviews to make sure we got the right talent. It is great to work with real industry insiders who specialize in talent for our sector. I highly recommend PTS.

   text: PTS responded timely while supporting our company with filling a critical and time-sensitive technical position that allowed our firm to meet an important contractual obligation for what turned out to be difficult to fill internally. I would recommend PTS to any firm requiring support with filling any “Key/Niche” position in a methodical and timely manner. They have the unique software to deliver and a proven track-record of finding great talent when you need it!

   text: We have appreciated the opportunity to partner with Precision Talent Solutions (PTS). Their dedication to understanding who we are as a company along with their commitment to engaging and presenting high quality talent within our budget enabled us to quickly fill a critical senior leadership role on our Business Development team. PTS’s ability to communicate in a clear and timely way with both Valiant and candidates made the hiring process much more productive and less stressful. Calling on Precision Talent Solutions in the future to support our key hiring needs is a no brainer.

<!-------------------------------- Why PTS threes--------------------------->

<section id="why-pts" class="padded grid-spaceAround center">
    <h2 class="col-12 p-b-3 p-t-2">Why PTS?</h2>
    <p class="col-12 p-b-2">PTS is not your average Exec Search firm or recruitment agency. We are
        consultative partners helping our customers solve the most significant challenge of the
        industry, talent. </p>
    <div class="col-3_md-12 why-pts">
        <h3 class="p-b-2">Experience</h3>
        <p>With over 400 years of cumulative government contracting experience
            from C-Suite to the field, our team knows the programs and agencies driving our
            industry. We have mapped the competitors, and each of our 30+ team members
            bring their network to our customers.    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3_md-12 why-pts">
        <h3 class="p-b-2">Technology</h3>
        <p> PTS is revolutionizing recruitment by leveraging disruptive technology
            to include video interviews and personality assessments with a chance of leadership
            success predictor, cognitive assessment, functional fit, 9-block predictor, and
            technical scorecards. Our virtual assessment center increases hiring quality and cuts
            overall costs. We invest heavily in our sourcing technology, including dozens of
            subscriptions to LinkedIn Recruiter, Clearance Jobs, Indeed, and X-Ray.   </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3_md-12 why-pts">
        <h3 class="p-b-2">Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Our recruiters understand the importance of building the right teams in
            this industry, as many of us served as hiring managers before PTS. We start every
            team meeting with the phrase “treat your candidates like customers”. Our
            philosophy towards empathetic recruitment personifies our core values of integrity,
            communication, respect, initiative, and added value.   </p>
