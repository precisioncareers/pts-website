         PTS provides a fully retained, highly consultative search to bring you
         top industry talent. We leverage our extensive network from across the
         industry and possess a market insider perspective to scout the best
         talent. PTS partners closely with executive stakeholders for C-Suite
         roles to understand the positions' rationale. We translate that
         understanding into a comprehensive search and serve as an extension of
         our client's strategy. All C-Suite mandates are led by an experienced
         PTS executive backed by a robust team. This gives our customers and
         candidates an "executive-to-executive" experience. Our virtual
         assessment center provides a more holistic view of the candidate-
         focusing on soft skills and leadership styles.

         Board-level roles require a niche perspective that can only be gained
         through networking across the top of the industry. Many of our team
         members previously held C-Suite and Board-level positions, giving them
         the necessary bona fides to fill these roles. As part of our give back
         to those that served in uniform, we mentor senior enlisted and
         Flag/General Officers as they transition from the uniform to the board
         room. This has built a broad network of retired military leaders we
         routinely tap into for influential scouting.

         Private Equity (PE) customers require a unique type of C-Suite talent,
         different from government contractors. We understand the need to cut
         costs, drive growth, and merge organizations. Our team will work
         closely with PE leaders to ensure their talent matches their distinct
         market position.
