   quote_html: Precision Talent Solutions operates at the intersection of candidate talent and pressing organizational needs of the most competitive companies in the Federal market. PTS understood how to translate my multifaceted skill set from the DoD space for the aid and development space. They identified the experience and traits that made me an ideal fit for a role in that segment of the industry. PTS is the first call I make when I am looking at strategic hires.
