   quote: I have heard Jake talk about his simple formula for success - treat folks the right way (both clients and candidates), work hard, and do a good job. I wondered if it was just Jake that was like this. Oh no, the entire team is this way. What a pleasure it is/was to work with these folks. I truly owe the opportunities I am enjoying today to the caring assistance I received from PTS.
