      <h2 class="center p-b-5"> Our Contained Search Model</h2>
      <p class="contained-model">Our unique “contained search” model offers a refreshing, flexible alternative to the prevalent and often ineffective “contingent” and “retained” recruitment models. It allows us to commit dedicated resources to each mandate and ensure successful results without exposing our clients to disproportionate risk. </p>
      <!-- <p class="contained-model">Contingent search agencies are not obligated to find a candidate, and simply provide you a high volume of resumes to see what might stick. With limited recruiter investment in a proper position intake session, candidate screening and due diligence, and customer intimacy, companies using contained search methods are not hiring the best talent in the market.  </p>
      <p class="contained-model">Retained search firms charge high fees, require permanent exclusivity, demand large upfront payments before any work begins, and recover a majority of their fees before you make a candidate selection. This approach subjects the client to a high level of commitment and financial risk.  </p>
