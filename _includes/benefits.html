      <p>You gain access to our extensive network of qualified, experienced candidates who can help drive your operations. Before we present any candidates, we pre-screen them thoroughly to ensure they possess all the technical and soft skills required for success. The pre-screening process includes a psychographic component that helps ensure the candidate is a cultural match for your organization.</p>
      <p>We assist you in compiling an offer designed to appeal to each candidate. Salaries serve as the primary motivation for most candidates; however, others are attracted to working with specific teams or want the prospect of further assignments after completing a short-term project. It's beneficial for recruiting passive talent â€” individuals who are already employed and aren't actively looking for a new position.</p>
      <p>We back our broad range of specialized technical recruitment and staffing solutions with our proprietary sourcing technology, which can decrease the time needed to fill a position by as much as 70 percent, and your employee turnover rate.</p>
      <p>At Precision Talent Solutions, we offer in-depth expertise and a wide range of services focused on supplying experienced, qualified talent for government contracting positions. Contact us today to learn more about how we can help your organization.</p>
