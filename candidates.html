   quote_html: I was approached by a recruiter from the PTS firm for a position that I didn't believe I was qualified to fill. Martyn Brooks, who works for Jake and is based in England, met with me nonetheless to see if we could find another position to discuss. The best interviewing process I have ever been part of and I am very excited about my new position at Gardaworld Federal Services.
