   writing: Finding the right Key Personnel for your bids is the difference between winning and losing. PTS bolts onto your Capture team to find the most compliant and compelling talent for your bids. We lead an intense recruitment campaign, conduct compliance checks, obtain market intelligence, and manage the Letter of Commitment process, allowing Capture leaders to focus on the capture, not the recruitment.

 - title: Vigorous Recruitment campaign
   text: Our team works round-the-clock to find your Key Personnel. We assign a team of Recruiters and Sourcers led by an Account Executive to handle your mandate efficiently. Our global footprint helps us work around the clock and through the weekend to find your bid winning candidates.
 - title: In-Depth Compliance Checks
   text: We work diligently to screen individuals we source. We run each candidate through a rigorous compliance check to ensure they meet your needs and standards. An Account Executive will thoroughly vet candidates before presenting them to you.
 - title: Managing Letter of Commitment
   text: Once our team finds your Key Personnel, we secure a LOC to attach to your proposal. While awaiting the award, our team will keep candidates warm. If a candidate drops out of the process at any point, we will work diligently to replace the individual.
